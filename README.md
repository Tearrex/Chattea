## Frontend
I fancied learning a new frontend framework with my underlying knowledge of vanilla JavaScript. Growing up, I was irresponsibly given a Facebook account‚ÄîSo I figured React would be a great candidate for exploring the rabbit hole! I was drawn to the idea of showing off the finished product to friends and it has kept me engaged throughout this learning curve‚Äîthe satisfaction of solving headaches beats the sorrow of feeling stuck!

### Secure Chats keys
![keygen](https://github.com/Tearrex/Chattea/assets/26557969/11bc4bad-22a2-4443-a3f1-895be8ee5d34)

In order for users to engage in end-to-end encrypted messaging‚Äînamed "Secure Chats"‚Äîthey must generate an asymmetric keypair within the app for handling ciphertext conversion. The resulting public key gets uploaded to the Firestore database, while the private key remains local to the user's browser for deciphering incoming messages. This keypair is unique to the user's current session and must be regenerated when switching across devices, losing access to old messages by design.

### Secure Chats feature

Prior to sending a chat message, the browser will encrypt the input value with the receiver's public key‚Äîbecoming a secure chat message. The ciphertext gets encapsulated in a secure HTTP request posting to Firestore for the receiver. Both users of a chat channel listen for live updates on the channel's timestamp to poll new messages from the opposite user. The receiver will use their own private key from local storage to decipher incoming secure chat messages.

### Spotify Web API search function

After retrieving an access token [from the backend](#spotify-web-api-token-function), the client can query the Spotify Web API directly for search results. The token is attached to the request headers.

## Backend
With Firebase being my most recent  cloud service integration, the free quota brought forward to me just how crucial it is to optimize bandwidth usage and general app performance for scalability‚Äîthis is my million dollar startup after all...

### User Data Caching
I subdued the concept of data caching as a consequence and applied it to Chattea by locally storing profile data fetched from Firestore, in place of a server-side cache. This relies on the client executing the correct frontend logic which is why the SDK credentials for production only work when accessed from Chattea's secure domain name.

Note: User IDs are substituted with generic names for readability.

### Spotify Web API token function
![spot_func](https://github.com/Tearrex/Chattea/assets/26557969/f7f9af41-8b6a-4c21-81a4-7fa9c03ebc0b)

To lookup songs [on the frontend](#spotify-web-api-search-function), users must first fetch a temporary access token for the Spotify Web API. The client calls a cloud function holding secret client credentials for an intermediate token transaction. The client will take the response token and keep it in local storage until it expires.

### Image cropping function
![imgcroptest](https://github.com/Tearrex/Chattea/assets/26557969/c1be3999-dab0-404a-93e5-f829a42c45c9)

The crop tool allows users to select the desired crop region for their image, fixed to a 1:1 aspect ratio relative to the shortest dimension of the image. After confirming the action, the image is compressed on the frontend as necessary before sending the binary data to a cloud function. The cloud function reads and writes the image to RAM so the result is never truly "saved" to disk storage until the user decides to submit their Chattea post.
