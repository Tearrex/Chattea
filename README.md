I wanted to learn React and start off with a social media platform. Before this, I was only familiar with jQuery (a blessing). Being comfortable with pure JavaScript, it was time to give myself a challenge—ON TOP of the social media challenge. I was drawn to the idea of showing it off to friends and it has kept me engaged throughout this learning curve. Sometimes I got so deep into a certain bug that I almost forgot this was only the front-end I was working on.
Though the satisfaction of solving these headaches beats the sorrow of being stuck!

I got the hang of using states, effects, and contexts to achieve several tasks. I am stoked with what I have put together so far!

With Firebase as the backend, I faced limitations that I had to work around—like how Firestore databases are queried differently from typical SQL. I also don't like how it's centralized by big tech, but that's a whole other topic. It is super easy to get started, however, and their services are admittedly convenient. Anyways, the billing really brought forward to me how crucial it is to optimize bandwidth usage and general app performance. I would have loved to develop my own backend and have full control over its functionality, but my main focus was learning React. Next time, though, I'll try using Node or Express.

Besides learning React, I sharpened up my CSS and I'm steadily introducing SASS into the mix. I have neglected flex boxes before creating this, now I can't get enough of them. Struggling with inline-blocks was a real pain but I never took the chance to try them out until now. My next goal is to implement TypeScript to shake things up a bit!

I'm still working on this religiously. I'm not sure if things will stay the same when it starts to scale but I will definitely need to improve moderation controls, spam filters and restructure the database to accommodate a larger amount of users.
