                        Chattea aims to be a painless social media platform where you can ramble about with friends.
                        The idea is that you can meet new people as they come along and vibe with those that
                        share similar hobbies or interests. You post updates of what you've been up to for those
                        curious about their surroundings.<br/>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Life gets rough sometimes. You can check-in whenever you like and perhaps you'll find
                        something that will cheer you up, or you can make a post that may brighten the day for others.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        At the moment, every user that is logged in
                        can see what you post. In the future,
                        you will be able to make it private for your buddies.<br/>
                        For now, post only what you are comfortable with sharing in public.
                        Please keep the content appropriate for everyone and be friendly to people you may not know!

                        To keep things simple, you <b>cannot</b> edit the posts that you make.
                        Same goes for comments.
                        Make sure to think it through before you send it!<br/>
                        You can always <i>delete</i> your posts later.

                        <p>
                        Buddies are your friends. Ideally, you should only make someone
                        your buddy if you know them.
                        This feature will be expanded upon to make it more useful later.

                        <p>Privacy concerns are a big deal! Here are the details:</p>
                        <p>When you sign up, the following is collected from you</p>
                        <ul className="dataSection">
                            <li>Username</li>
                            <li>Email</li>
                            <li>Password</li>
                            <li>Current date</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        This information is recorded on a database to keep track of every user that exists on the website.
                        Other websites follow a similar process, though they probably collect a lot more
                        and hide it behind a lengthy terms of service agreement that looks like gibberish‚Äîcan you relate?
                        </p>
                        <p>Every user is assigned an <b>identifier</b> upon signing up.
                        The identifier (ID) is a unique sequence of random letters and numbers that distinguishes you
                        from the rest of the users on Chattea.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Your identifier is logged when you do something like
                        </p>
                        <ul className="dataSection">
                            <li>Create a post</li>
                            <li>Smile a post</li>
                            <li>Add a comment</li>
                            <li>Add a buddy</li>

                        This is only used to make Chattea function properly. For the sake of transparency, this question will be
                        kept updated with the latest information of how your data is handled.
